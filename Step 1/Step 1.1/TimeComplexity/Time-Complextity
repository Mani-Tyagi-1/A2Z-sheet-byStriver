Time complexity --> The rate at which time taken increases with increase in the input size
It is represented in the form of big O notation --> O(complexity)

Rules
# Always calculate worst case time complexity
# Avoid constraints
# Avoid lower values

There are 3 type of notations 
1. Big-Oh (O) --> worst case (upper bound)
2. Theta --> average time complexity
3. Omega --> best case (lower bound)
